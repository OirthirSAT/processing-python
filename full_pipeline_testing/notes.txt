General notes:
- will need debugging after receipt of correctly formatted test images


Coastline Extraction:
- NDWI/NDVI for highlighting water
- Brown water has moderate NDWI, low to mod NIR, B/G <= 1
- contains 3 segmentation/clustering algos for testing. OTSU, k means and GMM. why? because 


To add and debug:
- debug everything
- flask image and data dashboard for debug and optimisation
- marching squares sub pixel vector extraction
- Entropy segmentation algorithm given accuracy and ability to ignore null pixels later on
